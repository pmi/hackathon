# SlackBot Hackathon

This hackathon is all about creating cool bot's for [Slack](https://slack.com).
We are going to use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for this since we have not
yet a fully working bot-framework for Enonic XP.

## Requirements:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed.
* [Enonic Slack](https://enonic.slack.com) account.
* Assigned a bot token (ask me for one).
* Current clone of this repository.

## Documentation

We are using [BotKit](https://www.botkit.ai/) in this example. Feel free to use
what you want, but I found out that [BotKit](https://www.botkit.ai/) has the
most features out of the box.

* [BotKit Docs](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme.md)
* [BotKit Docs for Slack](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-slack.md)

## Running

To run this example you will first need to set the token in `app/index.js`.
After that you can run the following command:

```
$> npm start
```
